# Concert Ticket Booking Website

This web app is created to allow users book ticket for their favourite artist concert, print and also download the concert ticket.

## Stack Used

Stack used for this project is NEXTJS, FRAMER MOTION and NODEMAILER(which will be incorporated later)

NEXJS is adoped to leverage on its backend feature, FRAMER-MOTION due to its simplicity in add animations and NODEMAILER for SMTP

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
